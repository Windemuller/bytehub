### What is Finance
Goal is maximizing value.
In math finance is the focus on monetary outcomes (with risk).

+ Finance is an umbrella term for decision making.
+ Under specific assumptions 'rational' preferences must be must be
measurable by values.
    + is the value of A higher than value of B ?

+ Development in (mathematical) finance.
    + DCF is long standing practice still mainstream.
    + options and derivatives require a more advanced method.
        + Black-Scholes option pricing risk neutral valuation.
    + still many paradoxes, unsettled issues, confusion and rationality.

Its tempting for experts to deem deviations

addresses the ways in which individuals and organizations raise and allocate monetary resources over time, taking into account the risks entailed in their projects.

## Traded Products

### Corporate bond:
+ Annual interest payments 2.5%
+ Repayment at maturity date
+ Price a bit above 100 yield


### Share
Buy a part of a company
dependent market performance.

### Options
Buy the right to buy or sell a share
in the future at a certain price.


### Other derivatives
+ Derivative: derives its value from basic financial products / interest rates / currency rates.
+ An option is a derivative whose payoff is nonnegative by definition.
+ Another type of derivative SWAP
    + Exchange two cash flow streams pay nothing at start contract.

## Valuation
+ Valuation is a powerful instrument in decision support
    + In a trading context, valuation is often called pricing.
    + As we saw, financial markets is a trillion dollar business.

+ Scope: products, projects, companies, funds...
+ Typically involves uncertain cashflow at a series of time instances.
+ The challenge is to summarize this into one number.

+ Present Value:
    + of something uncertain future payoffs / payment.
    + in number of euros / dollars of TODAY

+ Market prices are often regarded as best estimates of PV

### Value and time
+ What is the present value of getting 1 euro after T years from now.
+ Market price:
    + look up the risk-free interest rate r for period T in the 'term structure' of today.
    + compute price by discounting.

term structure: matter of supply and demand but also influenced by decisions of a central bank.

#### example:
rate r for period T means
+ PV(\$1 risk-free, 30 years form now) = $\frac{1}{(1 + 0.032)^{30}} = 0.39$
+ PV(\$1 risk-free, T years from now) = $\frac{1}{(1 + r)^T}$
with r the risk-free discount rate for period T.

#### Formula
+ In fact we can now handle any risk-free cash flow stream

+ Its PV must be $\frac{C_1}{1 + r_1} + \frac{C_2}{(1 + r_2)^2} + \frac{C_3}{(1 + r_3)^2}$
